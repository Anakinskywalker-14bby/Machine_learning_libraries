# Learning Python Libraries

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering key Python libraries commonly used for data analysis and visualization. Below are the libraries I'm currently exploring:

## Libraries I'm Learning

- **NumPy**: A powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
  
- **Pandas**: A fast, powerful, and flexible open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures like `DataFrame` and `Series` that allow easy handling of structured data.
  
- **Matplotlib**: A widely-used plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is essential for creating charts and graphs.

- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn makes it easier to create informative and attractive statistical graphics. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## Progress

I am actively working on various tutorials, exercises, and projects to get hands-on experience with these libraries. As I progress, I will add more examples, projects, and notes on what I've learned.

## Goals

- Gain proficiency in handling and manipulating data using **Pandas**.
- Master array operations and mathematical functions with **NumPy**.
- Create professional and informative plots with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Complete several mini-projects to demonstrate skills and understanding.
